# weatherapp

The Weather App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide weather updates for various cities. Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a loading screen that displays a custom background image, an application logo, and a loading spinner to indicate data fetching. The app uses the Provider package to manage state and fetch weather data from an API. If no city is specified, the app defaults to displaying the weather information for Mumbai. Once the data is fetched, users are navigated to the main screen where detailed weather information is presented. The clean and simple UI ensures a user-friendly experience, making it easy to check weather updates on the go.
